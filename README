Some things that are good to know:

 A config file looks something like this:
  root: {
    child: "child value";
    another child: "another child's value";
    child node with list: {
      "list item1 has some double-quotes:"" and "" such"" ";
      "list item2";
    }
  }

 Node names may contain any value except colon (':')

 Double-quotes in values are escaped as two doublesquotes ('"' -> '""')
 
 A node in the configuration may have a name (optional), and must have either
 a value or a subsection.

 Configuration syntax in EBNF:
 config-node = [<node-name> , ":"] , <config-node-list> | [<node-name> , ":"] , <node-value> , ";" ;
 config-node-list = "{" , { config-node } , "}" ;
 node-name = <node-name-character> , { <node-name-character> } ;
 node-name-character = ? any visible character except colon ? ;
 node-value = '"' , { <node-value-character> } , '"' ;
 node-value-character = ? any visible character, with each doublequote character escaped as two doublequotes ? ;
